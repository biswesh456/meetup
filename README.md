# meetup: a dialogue & vision task

This is mostly just a placeholder, so that we can already publish this URL. Very soon (said in early September 2018), you will find here the code for the bot that realises the meetup task, and the data that we have collected.

For now, you can find our 2 page abstract here for the ECCV workshop on [https://sites.google.com/view/sivl/](Shortcomings in Vision in Language), which introduces this task.
